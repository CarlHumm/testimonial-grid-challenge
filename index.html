                in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
              <p class="testimonial__review color-lightgray">  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

              <p class="testimonial__review">
                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                100% recommend! ”</p>

              <p class="testimonial__review">  “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
                gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
                junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
